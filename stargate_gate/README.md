# STARGATE: Gate

# Stargate

Stargate is device from Stargate franchise (Stargate (1994), Stargate:SG-1, Stargate:Atlantis, Stargate:Universe) which allows any element to be transported between great distances (planets, galaxies). All you have to do is ensure that stargate has enough power, then dial sequence of symbols (7, 8 or 9; address) that belongs to other stargate, wait for stargate to dial and then go through the event horizon!

# Stargate model and galaxy

Stargate models differ in their look, and the way they perform tasks such as dialling or locating other stargates. There are 3 (main) models of stargate:
- Milkyway
- Pegasus*
- Universe*

MilkyWay and Pegasus models differ only slightly - their look (and therefore animations and effects) are different, however they function the same way. They both can dial any stargate that is in the same galaxy as their own. However, the stargate itself does not produce any energy and requires external source of energy for the ability to dial and estabilish wormhole (DHD or other source). These stargates can also dial any stargate in any other galaxy - if they have enough additional energy (and their DHD is able to dial stargates from other galaxies).

Universe model works differently as it is designed to work in infinite number of different galaxies. Therefore, Universe model can dial only stargates in some (short) range. Also the stargate does not need DHD, because the gate itself is producing enough energy to dial. Except Destiny stargate, all universe stargates are unable to dial stargates in different galaxy than theirs.

Stagates are located in galaxy. The galaxy matters, because for different galaxies, there may be different stargate models (Milkyway, Pegasus, Universe) . In this script, there are currently these galaxies available:
- MilkyWay
- Pegasus**
- Universe**
- Ida**
- Ori**
- Other**

*These models are not available yet, however they are core part of this gamemode and will be implemented in further releases.

**In current releae, only MilkyWay galaxy is available as an option.
