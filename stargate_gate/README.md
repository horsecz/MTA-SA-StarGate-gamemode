# Gate script

Contains:
- Stargate model and textures initialization
- Animations (ring rotation, event horizon, kawoosh-vortex effect, etc.) including sound effects
- Element teleportation
- Physics - wormhole operations, "stargate laws"
- Stargate element basic functionality

Stargate element is element of type 'object' with custom ID (assigned on client-side) and custom stargate model.
All models are in 'models' folder and must be downloaded by client (as well as sound effects in 'sounds' folder).
This element has following properties:
- Element ID
    - Constant part **"SG"**
    - Variable parts **SGType** and **SGNumericalID**
    - SGType values:
        - MW
    - SGNumericalID values:
        - any number ranging from 1
    - Parts separated by **_** character
- Collisions: disabled
- Object Model ID: assigned by 'engineRequestModel' on client-side
- Attachments
    - Other elements with **similar Element ID** (same as stargate element ID **+ AttachmentID**)
    - AttachmentID values:
        - R
            - Gate ring model
            - Has one attribute (element data) 'ringRotation' containing time in ms needed to rotate ring to desired symbol 
        - C[N]
            - Gate chevron (active)
            - [N] represents number from 1 to 9; no. of chevron
        - TPM
            - Gate teleport marker at event horizon
        - H
            - Event horizon model
        - V
            - Vortex/Kawoosh model
        - KZM
            - Gate killzone marker (used at vortex position to kill player touching the vortex)
    - Note: Elements are *not attached* on stargate object *directly*, rather they just use similar ID with additional letter(s) at the end 
- Basic Element Data - stargate attributes
    - "address"
        - Address of this stargate
        - Array of numbers ranging 0 to 38 where 0 represents point of origin
    - "isRotating"
        - Is stargate's ring rotating?
    - "diallingAddress"
        - Stargate address that is being dialed by this stargate
        - See "address" attribute for format; can be nil if stargate is idle 
    - "active"
        - Is stargate active? (open, dialling or being dialed)
    - "open"
        - Is stargate open? (wormhole estabilished and event horizon present for teleportation)
    - "connectedTo"
        - ID of stargate which is this stargate connected to
        - primary use if this stargate's wormhole is outgoing
    - "connectedFrom"
        - ID of stargate which is this stargate connected from
        - primary use if this stargate's wormhole is incoming
    - "disabled"
        - Is stargate disabled? (unable to be used or dialed to; ex. buried, damaged, ...)
- Development Element Data
    - "horizonMainArray"
        - main timer for animating event horizon
    - "horizonArray"
        - array of timers for animating (six frames of) event horizon
    - "isHorizon"
        - value for marker; determine if marker is stargate's event horizon or not
    - "isVortex"
        - value for marker; determine if marker is stargate's vortex
    - "closeTimer"
        - stargate autoclose timer; defaults 38 game minutes
