# Stargate ENERGY script

Energy functionality such as powering stargates for additional energy sources as ZPM/Black hole to dial to another galaxy or to dial without DHD.

# TODO

- Basic energy functionality and logic
    - Devices for creating energy (DHD; Solar panel; Energy plants)
    - Devices for receiving energy (SG)
    - Energy storage devices (ZPM; batteries)
- Basic connection and co-working between resources
    - DHD creates automatically enough energy for stargate to operate (not broken)
    - Gates without DHD have 0 energy unless connected somehow else
