# TODO

- Physical devices
    - Devices for creating energy (Solar panel; Energy plants; etc)
    - Energy storage devices (ZPM; batteries)
- Basic connection and co-working between resources
    - DHD creates automatically enough energy for stargate to operate (not broken)
    - Gates without DHD have 0 energy unless connected somehow else
- Test: everything
