# To be done

- Prioritized issue: No LOD models
    - Big objects such as deserts, grass plains hide too soon (maybe same fix as SG dynamic objects?)
- Missing collision files for some objects (iris, kawoosh, chevrons)
- Stargate dynamic objects (chevrons, horizon are hidden too soon when moving camera - needs same fix as stargate model)
- Model IDs may be issue when more players join (or may not ...) - needs test
- Loading models in some areas may be better in smaller range (Atlantis: range <75 is enough) due to non-infinite memory thing
- Quality settings could be adjusted (mostly maps use <1 GB at top quality) per map or work more effectively
- Refactor
