## Complete to final release 1.0

Final release should include **most** of the features from Horizon of the Universe 2.0 implemented and working. The San Andreas map should **not** be totally dead, it should be the opposite - alive as in SinglePlayer (at best - the "aliveness" could be increased in further releases). Same goes for all other maps

- MilkWay galaxy
    - Stargate
    - All maps with interactions, functionality, peds
- Pegasus galaxy
    - Stargate
    - Atlantis map with interactions and functionality (other pegasus maps unavailable in 1.0)
- Universe galaxy
    - Stargate
    - Destiny map with interactions and functionality (other maps unavailable in 1.0)
- Login/Register UI
    - Simple players database
    - Saving last player position, players vehicle in SA (or different worlds)
    - Game tutorial for new players
- Working San Andreas map (spawn, gate area, shops, NPCs, ...)
- Galaxy map
    - Players can dial any stargate from bases (SGC, ATL, DST); in other worlds, they can only dial known worlds + these bases
    - Known worlds = planets that player discovered (was atleast once) and can dial from anywhere
    - Map will show known worlds for player
- Weapons, vehicles, peds from HOTU
- Story, freeroam mode, missions?
- Gamemode purpose? (action, modes, rp, ...)
- Maybe:
    - Freeroam/Sandbox world
    - All map interactions and functionality (all galaxies)
    - Custom maps/words
    - Unstable stargate wormhole physics
