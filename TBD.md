# What's needed to be done until first final release

Final release should include **most** of the features from Horizon of the Universe 2.0 implemented and working. The San Andreas map should **not** be totally dead, it should be the opposite - alive as in SinglePlayer (at best; the "aliveness" could be increased in further releases). Same goes for all other maps. 

## Expected features

Features listed here are expected to be present in completed final release. This list will probably differ (expand) in time:

- MilkWay galaxy
    - Stargate and DHD model
    - All maps with interactions, functionality, peds (and alarms, doors, elevators, stargate, energy, ...)
- Pegasus galaxy
    - Stargate and DHD model
    - Atlantis map with interactions and functionality (other pegasus maps probably unavailable in 1.0)
- Universe galaxy
    - Stargate and DHD model
    - Destiny map with interactions and functionality (other maps probably unavailable in 1.0)
- Gamemode features
    - Lifesupport and Planet UI
    - Planet distances
- Login/Register UI and saving player data
    - Simple players database
    - Saving last player position, players vehicle in SA (or different worlds), etc.
    - Game tutorial for new players
- Working San Andreas map
    - Spawn, gate area, other custom mapped places
    - Working interiors - shops, ammunation, homes, ...
    - NPCs - vehicles, peds
    - *Note: goal is that San Andreas won't be ghost city*
- Galaxy map
    - Players can dial any stargate from bases (SGC, ATL, DST); in other worlds, they can only dial known worlds + these bases
    - Known worlds = planets that player discovered (was atleast once) and can dial from anywhere
    - Map will show known worlds for player
- Weapons, vehicles, peds from HOTU
- Story, freeroam mode, missions?
- Gamemode purpose? (action, modes, rp, ...)

## Possible features

Some features listed here may be present in first final release too, but may be included in further releases instead:
- Freeroam/Sandbox world
- All map interactions and functionality (all galaxies and all maps)
- Custom maps/words
- Unstable stargate wormhole physics
- Shields
- Some other
