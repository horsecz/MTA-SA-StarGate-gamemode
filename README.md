# Stargate for MTA San Andreas

 Gamemode created for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas (1.6 and newer) which is multiplayer mode for GTA: San Andreas. Heavily inspired by and lots of things just 'converted' from STARGATE: Horizon of the Universe - San Andreas mod.

## This is ALPHA development branch

This project - gamemode is not completed yet. All scripts and parts of gamemode are gathered here, in this branch - they are tested to some extent, however they still probably have some issues, bugs and incomplete parts. **ALPHA** Development branch can be considered as **Alpha** version - unstable, many (most or all of them) features __untested__, __high probability of gamemode crashing__, not starting at all, __high probability of unexpected behavior and bugs__.

Features, changes and updates here are the newest, most up-to-date - unlike **development** branch, which is considered to be much more stable but also not the most up-to-date. All partial development branches (beginning name with *stargate_*) are synced with this single alpha development branch.

# ALPHA development has no release notes

Unlike **release** or **development** branches, there will be no release versions, notes or description of changes. If you wanna see what's new, see (and compare) the code from all scripts or test the gamemode.
