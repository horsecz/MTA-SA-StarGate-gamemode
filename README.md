# Stargate for MTA San Andreas

 Gamemode created for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas (1.6 and newer) which is multiplayer mode for GTA: San Andreas. Heavily inspired by and lots of things just 'converted' from STARGATE: Horizon of the Universe - San Andreas mod.

## This is release branch

This project - gamemode is not completed yet. When there will be *first* **final version**, it will be here, in this branch. Until then, see development branch, development-alpha or partial development branches. For releasing final version, the gamemode must be:
- stable
- completed
- tested

to some extent.

## Lastest release

Branch **release** is intended for final releases. Currently there is **no final release**, however you can look up into other branches (such as *development*) - there you can find *playable* versions of this gamemode.

## Branch differences

- **release**
    - stable
    - may contain bugs, however it's the most tested release, so there should be minimum of them
    - completed and complex features
    - gamemode must be able to load, start and work without crashing client or server
    - *this release is intended for playing and running on live server* and has full 'gamemode experience' (events, missions, map/ped/vehicle interactions, etc.)
- **development**
    - less stable than release, but still more stable than development-alpha
    - still needs some testing
    - new features completed (to some extent)
    - chances of game crash or gamemode not loading is low
    - *until first final release: this release is intended mostly for testing, there won't be any 'gamemode experience' until final release*
- **development-alpha**
    - unstable version
    - needs a lot of testing
    - contains the newest features - they may be incompleted or buggy
    - possibility of game crashing or gamemode not loading is high
    - *this release is intended mostly for testing and development*
- **previews**
    - contains screenshots or recorded videos from development (for feature and progress preview)
